/** This interface describes an instance of a connection between a repository and LCF's
* standard "pull" ingestion agent.
*
* Each instance of this interface is used in only one thread at a time.  Connection Pooling
* on these kinds of objects is performed by the factory which instantiates repository connectors
* from symbolic names and config parameters, and is pooled by these parameters.  That is, a pooled connector
* handle is used only if all the connection parameters for the handle match.
*
* Implementers of this interface should provide a default constructor which has this signature:
*
* xxx();
*
* Connectors are either configured or not.  If configured, they will persist in a pool, and be
* reused multiple times.  Certain methods of a connector may be called before the connector is
* configured.  This includes basically all methods that permit inspection of the connector's
* capabilities.  The complete list is:
*
*
* The purpose of the repository connector is to allow documents to be fetched from the repository.
*
* Each repository connector describes a set of documents that are known only to that connector.
* It therefore establishes a space of document identifiers.  Each connector will only ever be
* asked to deal with identifiers that have in some way originated from the connector.
*
* Documents are fetched in three stages.  First, the getDocuments() method is called in the connector
* implementation.  This returns a set of document identifiers.  The document identifiers are used to
* obtain the current document version strings in the second stage, using the getDocumentVersions() method.
* The last stage is processDocuments(), which queues up any additional documents needed, and also ingests.
* This method will not be called if the document version seems to indicate that no document change took
* place.
