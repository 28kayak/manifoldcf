Here on the Document Classes tab, you can configure which document
classes are ingested by this job, impose match conditions on documents
for ingestion based on metadata, and select which metadata will be
ingested with these documents. Each document class has its own section
on the tab with the following configuration options.

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Include?}
Check this box to include this document class in your crawl.

\item \textbf{Document Criteria:}
Here you can place match conditions based on metadata that will limit
which documents are ingested. By default, all documents of the given
class are ingested if the ``Include'' box is checked.

Match expressions are created by selecting a metadata attribute, a
match type, and entering a match string. First, select any of the
metadata attributed to the document class to use in the match
expresssion from the selection box on the left. Using the drop down
box, select the desired match type. An ``Equals'' expression will
include all documents whose metadata attribute is equal to the match
string you specify in the text box on the right. A ``Not equals''
expression will include all documents whose metadata attribute is not
equal to the match string. A ``'Like' (with \% wildcards)'' expression
includes all documents whose metadata attribute is matched by a
wildcard match string. The \% wildcard matches zero or more
characters. You can use it to create match expressions such as
``\%Test\%'', which will match any string containing Test, or
``Test\%'', which will match any string beginning with Test.

Once you select a metadata attribute, a match type, and enter a match
string, click the ``Add'' button to the left of the expression. The
match expressions will appear above the selection area. You can
continue to add more match expressions. To delete a match expression,
simply click the delete box that appears to the left of each
expression.

\note{The ``Ingest?'' box must be selected for match expressions to apply.}

\item \textbf{Ingest all metadata fields?}
If you wish to ingest all metadata fields, simply check this box.

\item \textbf{Metadata fields:}
Use this box to select metadata fields for ingestion
individually. Hold the ``Shift'' key while clicking to select a
range. Hold the ``Ctrl'' key while clicking to allow multiple
selections. You can combine these effects.


\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Mime types to include:}
Here you can select which mime types to include in your searches from
a list of types generated by the appliance. Initially, all mime types
are selected. You can select a single type by clicking on it, which
clears all other selections. To keep previous selections, hold the
``Ctrl'' key while clicking. Holding the ``Shift'' key while clicking
allows you to select ranges. You can combine these effects to select
multiple ranges.


\end{itemize}

\includegraphics[width=300pt]{fln-edit-job-tab6}

\begin{itemize}



\item \textbf{Security:} Select ``Enabled'' to use Active Directory
permissions with the ingested documents. You can configure custom
permissions using the ``Access Tokens'' tools, or accept the ACLs
as given in the FileNet repository. Select ``Disabled'' to allow all
document search users to access to the files ingested by this job.

\note{If you wish to enforce security, your appliance should be joined
to an appropriate Active Directory domain.}

\item \textbf{Access Tokens:} This field allows you to create custom ACLs
for the files ingested by this job. Enter the SID of a user or group
that you wish to add to the custom ACLs for documents from this job,
then click the ``Add'' button. You can continue to add more SIDs. These
SIDs will appear in a list. Click the ``Delete'' button next to any SID
to remove it from the list.

\end{itemize}


After entering this information, you will be taken to the status page
