must have
access to the web interface at
\url{http://metacarta.example.com/crawler/}. In the default appliance
security setup, you must have a Basic Authentication account
configured for access to the Connector web interface at
\url{http://metacarta.example.com/crawler/}.  If you are not an appliance
administrator, please ask the appliance administrator to give you such
an account.

An appliance administrator can create an account with access to the
ingestion interface (in this case, username {\tt fred} and password
{\tt ginger}) by running the following command on the appliance:

\begin{console}
metacarta:\~{}\$ basic\_auth\_control add ingest\_users fred:ginger 
\end{console}

Depending on how you have configured authentication using the
\command{auth\_control} tool, you may need to make changes other than
adding yourself to the ingest\_users group. For more information on
security configuration and \command{auth\_control}, see the Security
Administration section of the \documentref{MetaCarta Appliance
Administrator's Guide}.
