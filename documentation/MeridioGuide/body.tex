\section{Overview}

The MetaCarta GTS appliance indexes documents and allows users to
search these documents based on both keywords and geographic
references. The MetaCarta Meridio Connector Field Test allows system
administrators to configure connections to Meridio repositories and
define jobs to maintain synchronization between the repositories and
the GTS index.

This document specifies the means for connecting to these repositories,
indexing files from these repositories, and maintaining connections to
these repositories.

\subsection{Assumptions}

This document assumes you have a basic level of familiarity with GTS
appliance administration. This document also assumes that you have
a basic understanding of the repositories to which you are trying to
connect. If you need more information about the MetaCarta GTS appliance,
please read the \documentref{MetaCarta GTS Administrator's Guide} stored
on the appliance at \dirpath{/usr/share/doc/metacarta/AdminGuide.pdf}. For
more information about Meridio, please see your Meridio documentation
or Meridio administrator.

Throughout this document, we assume that your appliance is named \\
\url{metacarta.example.com}. 

\section{Installation}

The Meridio Connector must be used with the MetaCarta Connector
Framework, described in the \documentref{Metacarta Connector
Guide}. If you already have the Connector Framework installed, you can
install the Meridio Connector.  The Meridio Connector is
available as a field-test addon ISO file from from Metacarta. Use the
following steps to install the Meridio Connector to your appliance:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Confirm that the system is running correctly using
\command{check\_system\_health}.

\item Copy the disc image and md5sum supplied by MetaCarta to the
\dirpath{/isos} directory on your appliance. Rename the ISO file to
\dirpath{addon-mer-conn.iso} when you copy it to your appliance.

\item Check the md5sum of the ISO file using the \command{md5sum} command.

\item Install the iso using the following command:

\command{upgrade\_control install /isos/addon-mer-conn.iso}

The appliance will reboot once the installation is complete.

\item Upgrade your license file, if necessary, as described in
\documentref{MetaCarta Appliance Administrator's Guide}. You may need
to contact MetaCarta Customer Service to obtain the appropriate
license file. (Please see page \pageref{SupportContact} for contact
information.)
 
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{MetaCarta Meridio Web Service Installation}\label{SWService}

The MetaCarta Meridio Web Service must be installed on a Meridio
server running .NET framework version 1.1. The
Meridio Web Service installer at  
\dirpath{/usr/share/metacarta/MetaCarta}\linebreak\dirpath{MeridioWebServiceInstaller.zip},
is installed on your appliance when you install the Meridio Connector.
You will need to copy this archive to your Meridio
server and then unpack it. Read the file \dirpath{readme.txt} from the
unpacked archive, and follow the directions in the file. The package
also contains several executable files allowing you to install,
upgrade, or remove the Meridio Web Service. The detailed commands are
described in the \dirpath{readme.txt} file.

\section{Configuration}

\subsection{Access to the Connector}

The administrator to the Meridio Connector \input{access-input}

\section{Collecting Documents From Repositories} % Retitle this, yo.

The Connector Framework manages retrieving documents from different
repositories through \emph{jobs}. Jobs can be scheduled to run
regularly; each job connects to a single repository using a particular
set of credentials. Each job is tied to a \emph{repository
connection}. Repository connections contain information allowing the
connector framework to connect to a given repository --- that is, a
given Meridio server. Each repository connection is also tied
to an \emph{authority connection}. These authority connections manage
document security, making sure that when files have been indexed on
your GTS appliance, only authorized users are able to view them as
search results. Before you can create a job, you must create a
repository connection for the job to use. Each repository connection
should be set up with an appropriate authority, in this case a
Meridio authority connection. 

\subsection{Creating Authority Connections}

To create an authority connection, first go to the
main Connector Framework Administration interface at
\url{metacarta.example.com/crawler/}.  By default, your username and
password are the Ingestion Basic Auth username and password defined
earlier. 

You will see a sidebar like the one to the left. Click on ``List
Authority Connections'' and then you will be presented with the
list of authority connections. Click ``Add a new connection.''
You will see the following:

\includegraphics[width=300pt]{mer-edit-auth-tab1}

This is the first tab of the tabbed interface you will use to edit
authority connections. The next tab is as follows:

\includegraphics[width=300pt]{mer-edit-auth-tab2}


\input{sidebar}


In the first two tabs you must provide a name, description, and
authority type for your new authority connection. The name should be
unique, as you will use it to select this connection later when making
repository connections. The description should explain the authority
connection to you or another administrator. The authority type is the
type of authority to which you will connect, in this case a
MeridioAuthority.

Once you have filled in those tabs, click continue, and then you must
fill in the following extra tabs specific to Meridio Authority
Connections:

\input{mer-edit-auth}

\subsection{Creating Repository Connections}

Once you have created an authority connection, you need to create a
repository connection.
To do so, click ``List Repository Connections'' on the sidebar menu. Then,
when presented with the list of repository connections, click ``Add a
new connection.'' You will see the following two tabs:

\includegraphics[width=300pt]{mer-edit-repository-tab1}

\includegraphics[width=300pt]{mer-edit-repository-tab2}

Now you must provide a name, description, connector type, and
authority type for your new repository connection. The name should be
unique, as you will use it to select this connection later when
defining jobs. The description should explain the repository
connection to you or another administrator.  The connector type is the
type of repository from which you will get documents, in this case a
MeridioConnector. The authority type is the type of authority from
which you will get authorization information. Typically, you will
select the Meridio authority connection that you have set up to
associate with this repository; the permissions associated with the
ingested documents will be the same as the permissions of the original
documents in the Meridio repository. If you intend to force different
Meridio user and group permissions on your documents (see page
\pageref{ForceACL}), then you should select ``Standard (Kerberos)''
here. 

% Can you actually do that with Meridio?

%%% I asked Karl that very question, he said yes.

Once you have filled in those tabs and click continue to move on to
the repository-specific options.

\input{mer-edit-repo}

\subsection{Creating and Running Jobs}

To run a job, click ``Status and Job Management'' on the sidebar menu.
You can run or edit existing jobs from this menu.

To create a new job, click ``List All Jobs'' on the sidebar menu. Then, when
presented with the list of current jobs, click ``Add a new job.'' You
will be presented with two tabs, in which you must fill in the following
information:

\includegraphics[width=300pt]{mer-edit-job-tab1}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Name:} The name of the job. You will use this to identify
the job later.

\item \textbf{Collection:} The collection name metadata for all
documents in this job. End users can use this name to select the set
of documents in this job. For more information on collection name
metadata, please see the \documentref{MetaCarta GTS Administrator's
Guide}.

\item \textbf{Document template:} \input{doctemplate}

\end{itemize}

\includegraphics[width=300pt]{mer-edit-job-tab2}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Connection:} The name of the repository connection you
wish to use for this job. You select this from the list of repository
connections you have already made. You may have more than one job
use the same repository connection, but if you have two jobs crawl the
same documents, the documents will have the metadata and collection name
associated with whatever job crawled the document most recently. This will
cause unpredictable results for end users searching those collections
or searching for those documents, or administrators trying to delete
those collections.  We recommend never crawling the same document in
two different jobs.

\item \textbf{Start method:} Whether you want to start this job the next
time jobs are scheduled to run (``Start when schedule window starts''),
immediately after you finish defining it (``Start even inside a schedule
window''), or not at all (``Don't automatically start this job'').

\item \textbf{Priority:} From 1 (highest) to 10 (lowest), the priority
this crawl should have if it must compete for resources with other
crawls on the appliance. You should not need to change this unless you
are running more than one crawl at the same time; if you are, assign a
higher priority to the crawls whose documents you want to be processed
preferentially before documents from other jobs.

\end{itemize}

After filling in those options, click ``Continue,'' and you will be
presented with seven additional repository-specific tabs. 

\input{mer-edit-job}

\subsection{\label{ManageJobs}Status and Job Management}

You can then look at the status of your job by clicking ``Status and 
Job Management'' on the sidebar. You will see a list of one or more jobs
much like this one:

\includegraphics[width=300pt]{mer-jobs-list}

You can start any crawl you like immediately from this interface by
clicking ``Start'' next to the name of the crawl. This interface also
allows you to see how many documents have been crawled; this information
may help you structure and plan future crawls.

\note{Refresh this page by clicking the ``Refresh'' link at the bottom
of the page, not by clicking your browser's reload button.}

\section{Reports}

The Connector interface can generate two types of status reports, on
current crawl status, and four types of history reports, on past crawl
history.

\subsection{Status Reports}

The two types of status report are:

\begin{itemize}

\item Document Status, which lets you find information on individual
documents currently part of a job.

\item Queue Status, which lets you aggregate information about groups
of documents currently part of a job.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Document Status}

This report was generated by selecting ``Meridio Repository
Connection,'' selecting the document state ``Documents processed at
least once,'' selecting all possible document statuses, clicking
continue, selecting ``Meridio Job,'' and clicking Go.

\includegraphics[width=300pt]{mer-document-report}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Connection:} The repository connection from which to 
generate a report. You must select the repository connection and click
Continue to see all repository-specific options. %Are there any?

\item \textbf{Time offset from now:} Defaults to zero. Allows you to
see estimates of future status or, with negative numbers, a record of
past status.

\item \textbf{Document state:} Allows you to select documents that
have not yet been processed or documents that have been processed
at least once.

\item \textbf{Document status:} Allows you to choose one or more 
statuses of document to report on. The statuses you can choose are:

\begin{itemize}

\item Documents that are no longer active

\item Documents currently in progress

\item Documents currently being expired

\item Documents currently being deleted

\item Documents currently available for processing

\item Documents currently available for expiration

\item Documents not yet processable

\item Documents not yet expirable

\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Document identifier match:} A regular expression
allowing you to see only documents with matching identifiers. Meridio
document identifiers are typically numbers. To see all documents, use
a blank matching expression. Other possible match expressions include:

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{\^{}1}: Only documents whose identifiers begin with \texttt{1}.

\item \textbf{234}: Only documents whose identifiers contain the
string \texttt{234}.

\item \textbf{[1,2]\$}: Only documents whose identifiers end in
\texttt{1} or \texttt{2}.

\end{itemize}

\note{If you are not familiar with regular expressions, \label{regex}
there are a variety of tutorials available on the web,
including \url{http://gnosis.cx/publish/}\linebreak
\url{programming/regular_expressions.html} and
\url{http://perldoc.}\linebreak\url{perl.org/perlrequick.html}. If you
still have difficulty with these settings, please contact Customer Support
(see page \pageref{SupportContact}).}


\item \textbf{Jobs:} The job or jobs for which you want to generate
a report.

\end{itemize}

You can sort this report by any of the returned fields; to do so,
click the field names.

\subsubsection{Queue Status}

This report was generated by selecting ``Meridio Repository
Connection,'' selecting both document states, selecting all possible
document statuses, clicking continue, selecting ``Meridio Job,''
setting the identifier class description to \texttt{([0-9])\$}, and
clicking Go.

\includegraphics[width=300pt]{mer-queue-report}

This form offers the same fields as the Document Status report with
one addition, the \textbf{Identifier class description}, which allows
you to group results based on a regular expression. In this case,
documents are grouped together based on their last digit. The
ungrouped documents are all analyzed together in the first row of the
table. Other possibilities would be \texttt{(.*)}, which would put
each document in a group alone, or \texttt{\^{}(1)}, which would group
together all documents with the first digit \texttt{1}.  In this
second case, all ungrouped documents would be analyzed together in the
first row of the table.

\subsection{History Reports}

The four types of history report are:

\begin{itemize}

\item Simple History, which lets you list an ordered set of log events
based on chosen criteria

\item Maximum Activity, which lets you see the period of time in
which a certain event happened most often

\item Maximum Bandwith, which lets you see the period of time in
which the most bandwidth was used 

\item Result Histogram, which provides log information that would be
appropriate for constructing a histogram or other diagram

\end{itemize}

Each of these reports allows you to specify a connection, one or more
activities, a start time, an end time, an entity match, and a result code
match.  Some also allow you to specify an identifier class description
and a sliding window size. This section will show sample results for
each type of report and an explanation of the fields selected.

\subsubsection{Simple History}

This report was generated by selecting ``Meridio Repository Connection,'' 
clicking Continue, selecting ``document ingest,'' and clicking Go.

\includegraphics[width=300pt]{mer-simple-history-report}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Connection:} The repository connection from which to generate
a report.

\item \textbf{Activities}: What crawler activities you would like to
see.  Your options are document ingest, document remove, job
abort, job continue, job end, job start, and job wait.

\item \textbf{Start time}: The earliest time in the crawler logs to be
considered for this query.  Choose ``Not specified'' for any field to
start at the beginning of the crawler's logs.

\item \textbf{End time:} The latest time in the crawler logs to be
considered for this query. Choose ``Not specified'' for any field 
to end at the current time.

\item \textbf{Entity match:} A regular expression to limit the
Identifier field. In this case, the document identifier will be the
URL created for document retrieval, with the only unique portion being
the document identification number.
If the entity match field in the example above had
been \texttt{17\$}, only document fetches with identifiers ending
with 17 would be shown. For more assistance with regular expressions, see the note on page \pageref{regex}.

\item \textbf{Result code match:} A regular expression to limit the
ResultCode field.

\end{itemize}

You can sort the history report by any of the returned fields; to do so,
click the field names.

\subsubsection{Maximum Activity}

This report was generated by selecting ``Meridio Repository
Connection,'' clicking Continue, selecting ``document ingest,''
changing the Entity match and Identifier class description, and
clicking Go.

\includegraphics[width=300pt]{mer-maximum-activity-report}

This form offers two more fields than the previous form:

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Identifier class description:} A regular expression that
determines how to group identifiers together. If this were set to
\texttt{(.*)}, there would be no grouping, and so there would be only
one ingestion event per document. If this were set to
\texttt{([0-9])\$}, then all documents with identifiers ending with
the same digit would be grouped together. The setting in the example,
\texttt{()}, groups all documents together. Some other possibilities:

\item \textbf{Sliding window size}: The search interval in minutes.

\end{itemize}

The report returned will have only one result per group with one or more
documents in it, if there is a clear highest activity rate, or a list of
all the results tied for highest activity rate if there are more than one.

\subsubsection{Maximum Bandwidth}

This report was generated by selecting ``Meridio Repository
Connection,'' clicking Continue, selecting ``document ingest,''
changing the Entity match and Identifier class description, and
clicking Go.

\includegraphics[width=300pt]{mer-maximum-bandwidth-report}

This form offers the same fields as the maximum activity form, and
returns similar results; instead of tracking events per time window,
it tracks the window with the highest average bandwith usage, measured
in bytes per second. Again, the identifier class description has been
changed to a regular expression that will match all identifiers (and
thus in this case all documents).

\subsubsection{Result Histogram}

This report was generated by selecting ``Meridio Repository
Connection,'' clicking Continue, selecting ``document ingest,'' and
clicking Go.

\includegraphics[width=300pt]{mer-activity-result-report}

This form adds one new field:

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Result code class description:} A regular expression that
determines how to group result classes together; like Identifier class
descriptions but for result classes.

\end{itemize}

This report does not produce an actual histogram, but provides data that
could be used to generate histograms.
