Portions of the FileNet connector need to be compiled against a set of jars delivered along with the FileNet API.  The version of the API seems to matter; bugs are pretty rampant, and small point releases seem to be needed to correct them.

The version of the jars this connector was tested against come from Filenet P8 API 4.0.0 (P8CE-4.0.0-002-Win).  The jars were re-labeled with the prefix "ibm-" to avoid collision with the names of other jars, since many of them were common with other packages such as xerces, but had been modified in some way.
