\subsubsection{Documentum Job Options}

You must fill in the following extra fields if you choose to
configure a Documentum repository connection: 

\bigimage{Docu-edit-job-tab3}

\input{schedule-input}

\includegraphics[width=300pt]{Docu-edit-job-tab4}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Paths:} The directory paths in your Documentum
repository from which you want your crawl to start. You can specify
one or more directory paths. If you do not specify directory paths,
the job will crawl all directories on your Documentum repository. You
can build directory paths by selecting individual directories. To
start, select the base directory of the path you wish to create, then
click the ``+'' button. A new selection box will appear with the
directories contained by that parent directory. Select a directory at
that level and click the ``+'' button. Continue building your
directory path in this fashion. When it's complete, click ``Add''. A
new selection box will appear beneath the added directory path. You
can continue to add more directory paths to your list. To remove a
directory path from the list, click the ``Delete'' button next to it.


\end{itemize}

\includegraphics[width=300pt]{Docu-edit-job-tab5}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Document Types:} Select here the Documentum document
subclasses you wish to include in your job. Simply check the
subclasses you wish to include. The list of document subclasses is
generated by your Documentum repository based on existing document
subclasses.

\item \textbf{Metadata:} The Documentum repository stores various
metadata information about documents in its index.  You can select
those metadata fields here and have them sent along with the files you
index as metadata.  Each document subclass has its own selection box,
listing the metadata fields available for that particular
subclass. You can select ranges using the Shift key and make multiple
selections using the Ctrl key.  Metadata will not be geographically
parsed or used to create the index on the MetaCarta appliance;
however, with the standard MetaCarta Search APIs, you can construct
searches based specifically on this metadata. For more information on
the SOAP Search API, please see the \documentref{MetaCarta SOAP Search
API Guide}. For more information on the JSON Search API and KML Search
API, please see the \documentref{MetaCarta Guide to Web Services
Search APIs}.

\end{itemize}

\includegraphics[width=300pt]{Docu-edit-job-tab6}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Content Types:} Here you can select the Documentum
content types you wish this job include. This list of Documentum
content types is generated by your Documentum repository based on the
content types present in the system. These content types will not
correspond directly with the filetypes supported by MetaCarta;
however, the supported filetypes provide a rough guideline for the
types of content that can be ingested.

\input{supported}

Some content types are easily matched to filetypes; for example the
content type \command{html} corresponds to HTML documents, and the
content type \command{pdf} corresponds to Adobe Acrobat
files. Other relationships may not be as clear. The content types
\command{msw}, \command{msw3}, \command{msw6}, \command{msw8},
\command{mwsm}, \command{mswm1}, and \command{msww} all correspond to
Microsoft Word documents, while the content type
\command{doc} corresponds to an Interleaf\circler\ 3.x or 4.x
file. Your Documentum installation includes a full list of the default
content types and their formats at
\dirpath{%DM_HOME%/install/tools/formats.csv}. See your Documentum
documentation for more details.

If documents of a given content type cannot be ingested they will not
be indexed by the appliance.

\end{itemize}

\includegraphics[width=300pt]{Docu-edit-job-tab7}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Content Length:} The maximum file size, in bytes, that
you wish this job to crawl. Files larger than this size will be
skipped. The default maximum content length is unlimited. 

\end{itemize}


\includegraphics[width=300pt]{Docu-edit-job-tab8}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Security:} Use this option to enable or disable document
security. If you choose to enable security, user permissions will be
ingested with documents, while if you choose to disable security,
documents will be ingested without permissions.

\item \textbf{Access Tokens:} \label{ForceACL} If you wish to specify
your own ACLs for files ingested through this job, you can specify
them here. You should use this option if you selected ``Standard
(Kerberos)'' as the authority connection for your repository
connection and you are choosing to enable security. Simply enter one
or more ACL identifiers into the field and click the ``Add''
button. The ACL identifiers will appear in a list. You can continue to
add more ACL identifiers using the ``Add'' button, or remove them
using the ``Delete'' button that appears next to each ACL identifier.

\end{itemize}

\includegraphics[width=300pt]{Docu-edit-job-tab9}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Path Attribute name:} The name for the metadata field
representing path attributes. This should be a recognizable name
distinct from any of the metadata fields already associated with any
document type being ingested. It may be useful to have the metadata
field containing path attributes have the same name across jobs.

\item \textbf{Path-value mapping:}The regular expressions and
substitutions that you want to use to collect information from the
Documentum file path. You can construct one or more regular
expressions. In the example shown, there are two expressions. The
first, \verb+.*/(.*)/(.*)/.*+ to \verb+$(1) $(2)+, would change the
directory path ``Project/Folder\_1/Folder\_2/ Filename'' into
``Folder\_1 Folder\_2.'' The second, \_ to a space, would then be
applied to turn the metadata into ``Folder 1 Folder 2.'' It is
important to allow more than one transform so that you can, if
necessary, extract text data and then parse the extracted data. The
end result of the last transform will be ingested as the value of the
metadata attribute defined previously. For more information on regular
expressions, see the note on page \pageref{regex}.

\end{itemize}


After entering this information, you will be taken to the status page
for this job:
