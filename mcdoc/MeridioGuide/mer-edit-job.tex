\includegraphics[width=300pt]{mer-edit-job-tab4}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Paths:} The directory paths in your Meridio
service from which you want your crawl to start. You can specify
one or more directory paths. If you do not specify directory paths,
the job will crawl all directories in your Meridio service. You
can build directory paths by selecting individual directories. To
start, select the base directory of the path you wish to create, then
click the ``+'' button. A new selection box will appear with the
directories contained by that parent directory. Select a directory at
that level and click the ``+'' button. Continue building your
directory path in this fashion. When it's complete, click ``Add''. A
new selection box will appear beneath the added directory path. You
can continue to add more directory paths to your list. To remove a
directory path from the list, click the ``Delete'' button next to it.

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Security:} Use this option to enable or disable document
security. If you choose to enable security, user permissions will be
ingested with documents, while if you choose to disable security,
documents will be ingested without permissions.

\item \textbf{Access Tokens:} \label{ForceACL} If you wish to specify
your own permissions lists for files ingested through this job, you
can specify them here. You should use this option if you selected
``Standard (Kerberos)'' as the authority connection for your
repository connection and you are choosing to enable security. Simply
enter one or more Meridio user or group identifiers into the field and
click the ``Add'' button. The identifiers will appear in a list. You
can continue to add more identifiers using the ``Add'' button, or
remove them using the ``Delete'' button that appears next to each
identifier.

\item \textbf{Metadata:} Each metadata field that is available on your Meridio system is listed here.
