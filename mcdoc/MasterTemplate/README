So you want to edit the documentation!

MetaCarta's documentation build process goes something like this:

1. make calls Makefile; each document has a Makefile in its directory
2. Makefile says "pdflatex build.tex" ; this starts the build process.
3. build.tex inputs template.tex from MasterTemplate, which includes
   mcstyle.sty and produces the first two pages.
4. template.tex inputs localization.tex, which contians important things
   like "title of document" and "version." It also contains the year,
   which is important because we sometimes want to print 2007 documentation
   in 2008, &c. 
5. template.tex inputs main.tex, which might contain a table of contents
   and has an \include{} to the various files that have actual document
   text in them.
6. The document text files might input images (from mcdoc/DocumentName/
   Images/) or files from other documents (in which case the other 
   documents are in the TEXINPUTS in the Makefile). 
7. When this is done, make does it again twice (to deal with lastpage, 
   references, toc, &c.) and then moves the result to DocumentName.pdf

If you want to edit a document, you generally only need to edit the
document text files and localization.tex. When editing, there are a
bunch of commands you should know. To learn them, read mcstyle.sty in
this directory, which is commented for your convenience.
