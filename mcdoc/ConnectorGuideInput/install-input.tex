If you have not already installed the Connector Addon, you should use
the Connector Addon DVD to install it using the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Insert the DVD in your appliance.

\item Install the Connector Addon:

\begin{console}

metacarta:\~{}\$ sudo upgrade\_control install --from-dvd 

\end{console}

This will restart your appliance and eject the Connector Addon DVD.

\item Upgrade your license file, if necessary. For instructions,
see the \documentref{MetaCarta Appliance Administrator's Guide} or 
contact Customer Support (see page \pageref{SupportContact}).

\end{enumerate}

The Connector Addon cannot be uninstalled.

\subsection{Remote Updates}

In some cases, it may be very difficult to get physical access to an
appliance in order to install new software. To make the installation
process easier, MetaCarta provides a mechanism for remote
installations.  MetaCarta will provide you with ISO images of the
software you need upon request.  In brief, you can install the 
Connector Addon from ISO with the following command:

\begin{console}

metacarta:\~{}\$ sudo upgrade\_control install /path/to/iso.iso

\end{console}

For more information on the use of ISO
images for remote installations, see the \documentref{MetaCarta GTS
Administrator's Guide} stored on the appliance at
\dirpath{/usr/share/doc/metacarta/AdminGuide.pdf}.
