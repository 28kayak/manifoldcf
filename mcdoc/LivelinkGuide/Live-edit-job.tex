\subsubsection{Livelink Job Options}

In the Livelink-specific tabs, you will have the following additional
settings:

\bigimage{edit-job-tab3}

\ifLivelinkGuide
\input{schedule-input}
\fi

\ifCombinedConnectorGuide
This tab presents scheduling options. Here you can generate one or
more scheduled run times for the job. For a complete description of
the scheduling options, see the description starting on page
\pageref{scheduling}.

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Roots:} The base directories in Livelink from which you
want your crawl to start. You may select zero, one, or more than one
(though if you select zero, your appliance will not crawl anything). 
To select a directory, select the directory name, click the ``+''
button, and then click ``Add.'' The directory will appear inside the selection
box; you can click the ``Delete'' button next to it to remove it from
your list of directories to be crawled.

\end{itemize}

\includegraphics[width=300pt]{edit-job-tab5}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Filters:} You must define the files that will be 
crawled and indexed during this job. You do this by specifying filetypes
of the form ``\*.XYZ.'' You must specify at least one filetype to 
include, or you will not crawl any documents.

For example, if you want to crawl .QZX
files, you can enter ``\*.QZX'', select ``Include'', and then click Add.
You may define multiple inclusions and exclusions; if an exclusion and an
inclusion conflict, the first one you entered is followed.  

\input{supported}

To crawl and index all files, enter ``\*.\*'' and click Add.

\end{itemize}

\includegraphics[width=300pt]{edit-job-tab6}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Security:} Allows you to control whether or not file ACLs,
or access control lists, are passed to the appliance with the files. If
you select ``Disabled'' here, all files crawled from Livelink will be
visible to all GTS users.

\item \ifLivelinkGuide \label{ForceACL}\fi \textbf{Access Tokens:} If you want to pass on
your own Active Directory ACLs instead of those used by Livelink---or
your Livelink instance does not contain Livelink ACLs---you can enter
them here.  You should enter one or more SIDs that you want to have
read permissions on the files crawled in this job. Two special
Livelink tokens can also be entered. The token ``SYSTEM'' represents
Livelink system administrators, while the token ``GUEST'' represents
users logged into Livelink as guests. For more information about AD
ACLs and SIDs, please see the security sections of the
\documentref{MetaCarta Appliance Administrator's Guide}.

\note{If you have disabled security, these ACLs will not be passed to
the appliance.}

\end{itemize}

\includegraphics[width=300pt]{edit-job-tab7}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Ingest ALL metadata:} Choose yes if you want to ingest all 
metadata for each document crawled.

\item \textbf{Metadata:} The Livelink server stores various metadata
information about documents in its index.  You can select those metadata
fields here and have them sent along with the files you index as metadata.
Metadata will not be geographically parsed or used to create the index
on the MetaCarta appliance; however, with the SOAP Search API, you
can construct searches based specifically on this metadata. For more
information on the SOAP Search API, please see the \documentref{MetaCarta
SOAP Search API Guide}.

\item \textbf{Path attribute name:} The name of the GTS metadata
attribute to which you want to attach Livelink file path data, if any.

\item \textbf{Path-value mapping:} The regular expressions
and substitutions that you want to use to collect information
from the Livelink file path. Using the regular expression
rules on page \pageref{regex}, you can construct one or more
expressions. In the example shown, there are two expressions. The
first, \verb+.*/(.*)/(.*)/.*+ to \verb+$(1) $(2)+, would change the
directory path ``Project/Folder\_1/Folder\_2/ Filename'' into ``Folder\_1
Folder\_2.'' The second, \_ to a space, would then be applied to turn
the metadata into ``Folder 1 Folder 2.'' It is important to allow more
than one transform so that you can, if necessary, extract text data and
then parse the extracted data. The end result of the last transform will
be ingested as the value of the metadata attribute defined previously.

\end{itemize}

After entering this information, you will be taken to the status page
for this job:
