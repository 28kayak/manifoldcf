For the connector framework as a whole, these upstream difference files have been created to represent the changes we made for the following packages:

libcommons-httpclient-java.diffs, against debian version 3.1-2
libxerces2-java, against debian version 2.9.1-2

See the upstream-diffs directories in each individual connector for a list of upstream package requirements needed in order for that package to be built and function.

Also please note that the MetaCarta_logo.png file has been removed from the source tree, since it represents a MetaCarta trademark.  An appropriate Apache trademark should be used in its stead.
